Types include:
-T 0,1,2
0=Divide the space into unit cubes with sides equal to the diameter of the sphere. RRandomly choose a unit to place a sphere in. Allow spheres to move. 
1=Pick a random point and place the sphere there. No spheres overlap. Allow spheres to move. This could hang if it is impossible to place the number of spheres you want.
2=Pick random points for spheres. Don't worry about overlap. Boundaries do not move.
