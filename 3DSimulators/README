Three different versions of the program were made. All of them have the same arguments and output. The only difference is how the array of molecules is stored. 

fks1.1 - Stores molecules as a vector of pointers to molecule objects
fks1.2 - Stores molecules as a deque of pointers to molecule objects
fks1.3 - I am pretty sure this is the only one that works correctly. The others have problems near the boundaries of the simulations.

fks1.1 and 1.2 seem to be able to simulate 800k molecules but their speed is unreasonable.

PROGRAM CALL:
./fks -o temp -t 2 -f 1.0 -r 0.02 -s 10 -S 1 -E 3 -C 0 -B 0


The arguments for all simulators are as follows:


-o Output file name 
-t Time steps to simulate
-s Size of space to simulate (s x s x s). The space is a cube or square
-f Probability E binds S if they collide
-r Probability C dissassociates into A and B when it moves
-E Number of E molecules
-S Number of S molecules
-B Number of boundary elements
-C Number of C molecules

OUTPUT FILE
This is a .csv file that contains the following information

time,S,E,C

where S,E,C are the number of molecules of each type at the given time.
