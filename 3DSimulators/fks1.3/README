Command Line Arguments

i -  input file for reading initial positions. 
o -  output file name
t -  Total Time simulated 
s - Size of space. Simulator sets-up SxSxS Cube. No periodic boundary conditions
f - Forward probability. Probability of binding after colliding
r - reverse probabilty. Probabiliy of disassociating
T - Type of boundaries. 0 = xyz type file, 1= xyzr type static boundaries, 2 = xyzr type dynamic boundaries
-O - Type of output generated. 1=summary, 2=datadump, 3= summary plus initial conditions


###### I haven't gotten rid of the following arguments and they need to be given ####

-E 
-e
-S
-a
-C
-b
-B

You can set them all to zero

Example Call:
./fks -f 0 -r 0.02 -o sumplus -s 102 -t 10  -T 1 -i input.dat -O 2 -E 0 -e 0 -S 0 -a 0 -C 0 -b 0 -B 0

Format of input.dat
No header!! But I include names for clarity here

You must have the molecules sorted by type if you are using static boundaries. Basically the simulator will move the molecules at the begining of the list. If you are using dynamic boundaries the order doesn't matter.
