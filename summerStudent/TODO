## Boundary Metrics ###

Given an outputed Debug.csv file as input write a program that calculates the following metrics

1) Percent Crowding by the boundary elements
2) Accessible volume of the Enzyme/Substrate
3) Average Accessible volume of the Enzyme/Substrate
4) Average Rate of Diffusion for each of the Molecules in the simulation
5) Fractal dimension of accessible volume

## Initialization of the Space ###
Programs Need to be written to generates spaces that have different values for each of the metrics above

Space 1:
Random placement of spheres on maximum packing lattice

Space 2: 
Random placement of spheres of differnt radius on maximum packing lattice
up to 10 different sized spheres

Space 3: 
Create a 2D surface in 3D space with fixed substrate on it
