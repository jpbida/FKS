##### Fractal Dimension ##########################################

Files

rpgms - functions.r 
	fdim(file_in,dataset,res,size_space)
	### Calculates the fractal dimension in 2D/3D of a square or cubic space ####
	file_in - file containing the high resolution pixelized file
	size_space - This is the size of the space
	dataset - the name of output file plus an prefix
	res - highest resolution pixels

Notes:
The resolution and the size of the space should be related by: 
	2^10 * res = size_space
If the size of your space is 1000 each pixel should be 0.97x0.97x0.97. Your pixelized dataset should contain three columns with the x,y,z indices of each pixel. The format of the files should be space separated 3 columns, with no header.

0 0 0 would correspond to the pixel 0.97,0.97,0.97 and so on.

The function also removes any pixels that are outside of the space you input.
